    <h1>Assignment 2: Data Exploration</h1>
    <div>
        <p>For this visualization I used a data set from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness'>Kaggle </a>based
            on the <a href='http://worldhappiness.report/'>World Happiness Report</a>. This report explores happiness around
            the world based on different "social foundations for individuals and nations" (worldhappiness). The overall Happiness
            Score data is displayed, along with Economy, and Trust. Economy is based on GDP per capita and Trust is the overall
            trust of the citizens and their government.</p>
        <p>I decided to visualize the data with a <a href='https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063530'>circle packing</a> graphic.
            The circle packing layout allowed the data to be grouped based on regions of the world. The different regions
            were encoded with a color that showed a group of circles were part of the same group. Space was also utilized
            to show what the groups were. A legend helps identify what color pertains to the region of the world. Within
            these regions the different country values, encoded in the size of the circles, could be compared with each other.
            The larger the circle, the higher this social factor contributed to the overall Happiness Score. As one hovers
            over the circles, the name of the specific country displays.</p>
        <p>The Happiness Score controller, encodes the overall Happiness Score for specified countries. The larger the size
            of the circle, the higher the country scored. Based on the region groupings, you can identify which regions overall
            have a high Happiness Score and within those regions, which countries have a higher overall Happiness Score.
            The Economy controller, helps identify which regions and countries have high or low Economy scores. The Trust
            controller, like the other controllers, helps identify which regions and countries have high or low Trust scores.</p>
        <p>When comparing the three visuals when changing the controllers, it is interesting how the overall Happiness Score
            visual has relatively same sized circles. When the Economy and Trust controllers are toggled, there are move
            obvious differences. For example, the Sub-Saharan Africa region in the Economy visual is easily identifiable
            as the region with the most variation in GDP per capita. Another example, in the Trust visual, within the
            different regions, there are several countries that have high trust and then countries on the opposite end. </p>
